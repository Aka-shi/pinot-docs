# Minion

Pinot Minion is a new component which leverages the [Helix Task Framework](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2019/01/managing-distributed-tasks-with-helix-task-framework) . It can be attached to an existing Pinot cluster and then execute tasks as provided by the controller. It's a generic and single place for running background jobs. They help offload computationally intensive tasks—such as adding indexes to segments and merging segments—from other components.
